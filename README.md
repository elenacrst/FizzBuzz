# FizzBuzz

The app asks the user for a number and returns an array with the numbers from 1 to the specified number, but the numbers divisible by 3 are
replaced by 'fizz', the numbers divisible by 5 are replaced by 'buzz' and those divisible by both 3 and 5 are replaced with 'fizzbuzz'.For 
example, if we enter 15, we should get an array of 1, 2, ‘fizz’, 4, ‘buzz’, ‘fizz’, 7, 8, ‘fizz’, ‘buzz’, 11, ‘fizz’, 13, 14, ‘fizzbuzz’.
